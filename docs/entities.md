# Entities

All stuff you can edit, create, overview, delete and whatever else you want to do is called **entity**. That includes users, posts, categories, tags, products, etc. Meta-data about each entity should be fetched from a server API and contains the following:
* Titles for each type of page (index, create and edit)
* Index fields config
* Filter fields config
* Create/edit fields config
* Permissions
