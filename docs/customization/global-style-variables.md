# Global style variables

Just create `admin/src/shared.styl` file and define your stuff here. Note that this file will not suppress the original [`vue-admin-front/src/shared.styl`](https://github.com/mrTimofey/vue-admin/blob/master/src/shared.styl) so you do not need to import it manually. Both files will be included in every component style or standalone stylus file.
